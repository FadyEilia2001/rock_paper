## How to Play

### How to Play

Rock Paper Scissors is a simple two-player game where each player chooses one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The rules are:
* Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors).
* Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper).
* Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock).
* If both players choose the same option, it’s a tie.

In this version, you’ll play against the computer. Each round, you and the computer both make a choice, the winner is determined, and the score is updated. After 5 rounds, the overall winner is declared.
